# KeepABPOn
I will never turn off my ABP for your ridiculous, unreasonable and unbearable excuses.


# Description
**No websites should ever forced a user to turn off their ad blocker unless he wanted to.** 

I create this repository for this purpose: Ads should never interrupt normal reading experience.
